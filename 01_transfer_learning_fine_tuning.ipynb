    "# Transfer Learning Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall *Practicum AI*'s heroine Amelia, the AI-savvy nutritionist. At the end of our *[Deep Learning Foundations course](https://practicumai.org/courses/deep_learning/)*, Amelia was helping with a computer vision project. If only she had known about transfer learning, it could have saved her a lot of time! In this notebook, we will get some hands-on experience with transfer learning and show you how to use it to improve your workflows.\n",

    "\n",
    "## AgriNet background\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is based off the 2022 Sahili and Awad *Frontiers in Plant Sciences* paper [The power of transfer learning in agricultural applications: AgriNet](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.992700/full). In this paper Sahili and Awad explore different models using a large dataset of over 160,000 images. While the full dataset is too large for this exercise, we have made a subset of the data, and will use a similar approach as we explore transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI Pathway review for transfer learning & AgriNet \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have taken our [Getting Started with AI course](https://practicumai.org/courses/getting_started/), you may remember this figure of the AI Application Development Pathway. Let's take a quick review of how we will apply this to our case study of AgriNet and it's use of transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "![AI Application Development Pathway image showing the 7 steps in developing an AI application](https://practicumai.org/getting_started/images/application_dev_pathway.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a problem to solve:** In this example, we will try to make a computer vision model that can recognize images of plants and categorize them as \"healthy\" or in one or more disease classes. As you will see when you explore the data, there are over 20 crops and some have as many as 11 disease states. In total, there are 73 categories!\n",
    "2. **Gather data:** The data for the example comes from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zahraa/AgriNet), a great repository of datasets, code, and models. \n",
    "3. **Clean and prepare the data:** While the dataset is already fairly good, we have done some further processing of the data:\n",
    "    * We have removed some crops with no \"healthy\" category. We have combined lemon into the Citrus category. We dropped some crops with relatively few images. \n",
    "    * Most importantly, we have made the dataset a bit more realistic and manageable for the course. **We have randomly subsampled the images so that each category has no more than 100 images in the training set**.\n",
    "    * The details of the modifications are in the [Data_processing.ipynb notebook](Data_processing.ipynb).\n",
    "4. **Choose a model:** For reasons of efficiency and training speed, we will use the EfficientNet-B5 model (more on that below). The EfficientNet models are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We will train from scratch as a baseline (using randomly initialized weights, not the pre-trained weights), and compare that to starting with a pre-trained model that we fine-tune on the AgriNet dataset. We will use an EfficientNet-B5 model trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large dataset of images with 1,000 classes. By fine-tuning this model, we can leverage the knowledge the model has learned from the ImageNet dataset and apply it to our specific problem of plant disease classification. Since the *domain* of ImageNet is distinctly different (1,000 everyday objects) from the domain of AgriNet (healthy and diseased plants), this is a **Domain Transfer** example. \n",
    "   * In the step where you'd choose a model, one can approach this many ways, for this notebook we'll just mention two:\n",
    "      * **Train from scratch:** This is where you start with a randomly initialized model and train it on your data. This can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "      * **Domain Transfer via Fine-Tuning:** This is where you start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on your data. This is often faster and requires less data.\n",
    "5. **Train the model:** As mentioned in step 4, we'll demonstrate two approaches in this notebook:\n",
    "      - Training the EfficientNet model architecture from scratch.\n",
    "      - Fine-tuning an EfficientNet model pre-trained on ImageNet, a domain-specific dataset to achieve Domain Transfer.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate the model:** We will use the metrics we gather to make decisions about the model. \n",
    "7. **Deploy the model:** We won't get to this stage in this course, but ideally we would end up with a model that could be deployed and achieve relatively good accuracy at solving crop classification problems.\n"

    "\n",
    "[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/) is an open-source framework built on top of PyTorch that makes training deep learning models more straightforward. It abstracts many common tasks like managing training loops, logging, checkpointing, and handling hardware setups, allowing you to focus on the core aspects of your model and experimentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than writing repetitive code, you define key methods—such as `training_step` and `validation_step`—to describe the model's behavior while the Lightning trainer automates optimization details, synchronization, and even distributed training. This separation between scientific code and engineering routines leads to cleaner, more maintainable projects that are easier to scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, PyTorch Lightning integrates smoothly with popular tools such as [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), which simplifies tracking experiment metrics and visualizing performance. Overall, Lightning streamlines the training workflow, boosts reproducibility, and helps both beginners and seasoned researchers concentrate on innovation, not boilerplate coding.\n",

As the number of available processors increases, the processors can keep the GPU fed with input images. With fewer than 8 cores, the GPU sits idle for much of the time, waiting for data from the processors. The speed of your filesystem is also a component here, but not as easy to change.\n",
